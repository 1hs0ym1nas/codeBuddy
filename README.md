### 🚀 TECH STACK

Here's a brief overview of the tech stack CodeBuddy uses:

- This app is built using Apple’s UIKit framework, which allows for a seamless and native iOS application experience.
- This app utilizes [Firebase Firestore](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) to store user data, including answers and progress. This real-time cloud database ensures seamless synchronization across devices.
- This app utilizes [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to handle HTTP requests. This is used to fetch question details from a third-party LeetCode API.
- This app supports [Google Login](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS) and [Facebook Login](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk), providing users with secure and quick authentication options for streamlined access.
- This app integrates with a third-party [Leetcode API](https://github.com/alfaarghya/alfa-leetcode-api/) to fetch problem details such as descriptions, examples, and difficulty levels.
- Powered by Apple’s [Speech](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech) Framework, this app enables voice input for solving problems.
